6.minification -> uglyfy
minification: process of reducing the size of JS.
using string to against problem caused by minification
DI in Angular needs to be minification proof
two ways out:
1.inline array with function as last element,
2.Attach $inject property to the function object,


7.digest cycle
In angular context($scope)
Watchers check the property, at least twice, one for changes, until nothing changes
for each property reflecting in html, angular created a watcher for it;

8.one time binding:{{::prop}}
once the binding property is reflecting in view, its watcher is detached.

9..service(), .factory(), .provider()
.service():singleton
.factory():more than one instance of service is possible
.privder(),
.config(), get called before any other services, factories, or controller is instantiated.

restrict: A for attribute like ng-repeat, E for element like <filter-top>
